Based on the code and tests, I suggest this ordered approach:

Basic Atoms & Simple Rules (Start here)

Comments (#...)
Whitespace handling
Simple identifiers
Basic values/arguments
Default Entry Parsing (Currently working on)

Global defaults (Defaults env_reset)
User defaults (Defaults:user ...)
Host defaults (Defaults@host ...)
Command defaults (Defaults>cmd ...)
Alias Definitions

User_Alias
Host_Alias
Cmnd_Alias
Runas_Alias
User Specifications

Basic user host=command format
Command lists
Tags (NOPASSWD, NOEXEC, etc.)
RunAs specifications (user:group)
Complex Structures

Nested specifications
Multi-line entries
Include directives
Variable substitutions
Transform Rules (in parallel with above)

Convert parsed structures to Ruby objects
Handle nested structures
Deal with optional elements
This order makes sense because:

We start with the foundational pieces (atoms)
We're currently working on Defaults which is a good middle-ground complexity
Each subsequent task builds on previous knowledge
We can validate each piece independently
The transform rules can evolve as we add more parser rules

1. Complete Parser Implementation
   - Finish alias definitions
   - Add user specifications
   - Add command lists
   - Add tags (NOPASSWD, etc.)

2. Add Transform Rules
   - Create transform structs for each type
   - Add transform rules matching parser output
   - Add transform tests
